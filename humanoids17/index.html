				<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>

				<p>This will be the 3rd workshop titled “Can we build Baymax?”. The 1st workshop was held at Humanoids 2015 in Korea and the 2nd one was at Humanoids 2016 in Mexico. Baymax is a humanoid character in the Disney feature animation, “Big Hero 6.” It is a healthcare robot with an inflatable body, capable of walking, bumping into surrounding objects and physically interacting with people. However, in the real world, it is not easy to build such a robot. In the previous workshops, we have discussed topics on mechanisms and structure, sensors, protection, and fabrication regarding such special soft robots. As a continuation of the discussion, this workshop will bring together researchers focusing on practical technologies to realize soft human-robot interaction, and tackle challenges on design and control for soft robots like Baymax to accommodate the unstructured and clustered world. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
					<ul>
					<li>Design of back-drivable and/or torque controllable joint mechanisms</li>
					<li>Design and control of soft actuators</li>
					<li>Safety/softness in physical human-robot interaction</li>
					<li>Contact wrench and position estimation techniques</li>
					<li>Soft human-robot interaction application in wearable and haptic devices</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
